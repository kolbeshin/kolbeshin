## Employment Histoty
- ### Startup
  - I was developing the back-end part of a web application for a project that imports a replacement for Tyromotion, an organization that left Russia (Tyromotion was engaged in rehabilitation of limbs after surgical interventions or due to human peculiarities by means of playing games, the results of which are recorded by sensors attached to the limbs). 
As part of the project, I wrote a modular monolith, as a microservice approach is not rational in this situation. The language chosen was Golang with Gin frameworks (for wrapping over standard http), GORM (for database interaction). I wrote authentication on JWT tokens, the token itself is transferred in cookies. Interaction with the client is realized through REST API. DBMS - PostgreSQL. Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt. For application deployment I used docker compose.
